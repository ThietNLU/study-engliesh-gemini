## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### SM-2 Algorithm Constants
```javascript
MIN_EASE_FACTOR: 1.3
INITIAL_EASE_FACTOR: 2.5
INITIAL_INTERVAL: 1 day

Rating Effects:
- Again: Reset to 1 day, -0.2 ease factor
- Hard: 85% interval, -0.15 ease factor  
- Good: Normal progression
- Easy: 130% interval, +0.15 ease factor
```

### Database Schema
```
users/{uid}/cards:
  - front, back, category, level
  - interval, easeFactor, repetitions
  - lastReviewed, nextReview
  - totalReviews, createdAt, updatedAt

users/{uid}/reviews:
  - cardId, rating, reviewedAt, timeTaken

users/{uid}/sessions:
  - startedAt, endedAt, completedCards
  - stats (again/hard/good/easy counts)
  - filters, duration
```

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. **Access Flashcard System**:
   - Click "Flashcard" button in navigation to study
   - Click "Quản lý thẻ" to manage cards
   - Click "Thống kê" for statistics

2. **Import Existing Vocabulary**:
   - Go to Flashcard Manager → Import → "From Vocabulary Collection"
   - Automatically converts all vocabulary words to flashcards

3. **Study Session**:
   - Configure filters (category, level, status)
   - Start session with available due cards
   - Rate each card: Again/Hard/Good/Easy
   - Track progress with real-time statistics

4. **Export/Backup**:
   - Export to CSV for spreadsheet use
   - Export to Anki format for external apps
   - Future: .apkg support planned
